title: My First Ruby Gem

<h1 id="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>

Last week I published [my first Ruby Gem, "Invoices"](https://rubygems.org/gems/invoices), a simple invoice generator for the OSX command line that takes Git commit messages and turns them into monospaced .txt invoices.

Essentially a prototype [(check out the "to do" list)](https://github.com/amacy/invoices/blob/master/README.md), it's not particularly useful to anyone in its current form. And it may never be. But, as someone with mostly front end experience, diving into the back end was challenging - and the most fun I've had programming in a long while. I've also learned a ton.

Constructive criticism welcome.
